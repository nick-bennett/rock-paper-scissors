/**
 * This class models cyclic dominance in a simplified ecosystem as a form of the game
 * Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), played on a toroidal terrain. RPS interactions happen between pairs of
 * neighboring {@link Breed} instances located on square lattice points on a 2-dimensional torus. In
 * each iteration, one such pair is chosen at random, with the loser replaced by an instance of the
 * winner's breed.
 * <p>
 * This model may also be viewed as a 2-dimensional, 3-state stochastic cellular automaton (CA). The
 * state of each cell in generation (<i>n</i> + 1) is based on the state of that cell in generation
 * <i>n</i> and the random selection of a single cell and one of its neighbors. If a given cell is
 * note one of the 2 randomly selected cells, then its state is unchanged; otherwise, the new state
 * of that cell (and that of the other cell selected at random) is based on the outcome of the
 * conflict between the 2 cells &ndash; that is, on the RPS game played between them.
